The temptation too great, no child could refuse the siren's call of the game's accurate physics model and competitive nature.<br><br><strong><i>Notebook Artillery</i></strong> is a love letter to <strong>hours </strong>wasted playing video games in Middle School computer labs instead of working on class assignments. And sure, maybe if I would've spent more time paying attention in class and less time playing video games I wouldn't be making indie games as a means to pay off insane amounts of student debt. But hey, its 2020 and maybe this can be one last beacon of hope for myself and everyone who loves this kind of game. <br><br>Players choose their &quot;firing angle&quot; and &quot;powder amount&quot; to fire cannonballs at opposing player's towers, or break floating targets in a solo player target practice mode. The randomly generated stage layouts will change strategy from round to round, and wind strength has an effect on a cannonball's trajectory which players must account for. Its simple arcade-simulation-action, fun for all ages, with completely hand drawn game art running at a gorgeous 4K. It's like you're looking directly into a Trapper Keeper and the imagination of every middle school kid. Whats not to love?<br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>    Hand drawn game art in gorgeous 4k.<br></li><li>    Play Solo target practice, or challenge local friends and family in vs mode.<br></li><li>    3 unique world styles fashioned after various wild west motifs.<br></li><li>    Stage layouts are randomly generated to make no two games the same.<br></li><li>    Fight the wind and dodge trees to destroy opponents strongholds.<br></li><li>    Completely visual buttons, no in-game writing.</li></ul><br>This was such a fun game to make, and it's so much fun to play with my kids, I hope you find it as fun as I do. And for fans of the original Macintosh classic, I hope this fulfills the desire to play this game again.<br><br>Made with GameMaker Studio 2\n"

Will you stay to build a more colourful life, of leave it behind in search of greener pastures?<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1433240/extras/Custom_-_cargo.png?t=1641607602\" /><br><br><strong> Game Play </strong><br><i>Whiskey Island</i> is a 3D immersive environment with a first-person point of view.  Explore the island on foot, drive trucks, or operate locomotives to assemble trains and switch tracks.  The basic idea is to use trains and trucks to transport cargo.  Pick up resource cargos from various locations around the island and deliver them to factories and mills for processing.  The finished goods can then be transported to other factories or to the Seaport for final delivery.<br><br>Transporting cargo will keep the wheels of industry turning, and <i>Whiskey Island</i> can be a busy place when the lumber mill, fruit factory, smelter, metal works, and distillery are operating at full capacity. Factories and mills require resources including logs, ore, grain, fruit, boxes, barrels, and general supplies, to produce products, and the finished goods must be removed from the loading docks in a timely manner or production stops.  Be careful to maintain your equipment - the trucks and trains need fuel and maintenance to operate efficiently. Thankfully the Island Garage and the Railway Workshops are there to help.  <br><br><i>Whiskey Island</i> can also be a relaxing and casual escape if you'd rather just drive trucks and trains, explore beaches, and hike in the mountains without worrying about cargo.  Building production may stop for a while - it can always be restarted by transporting cargo when you're ready.  <br>  <br>Gold is earned for each cargo unit delivered, and <i>Whiskey Island</i> becomes a more colourful place as your Happiness level increases.  But beware!  If you leave on the next tramp steamer, you will leave the Island behind as a distant and fading memory.<br><br><i>With Trucks, Trains, and Transport, places to go and things to do, <strong>Whiskey Island</strong> is waiting for you!</i>\n"

Their development is on the brink of offering thousands of promising players the chance to grow to the top of the tennis world. <br>Yet, everything remains to be done. As a manager, it is your opportunity to develop your academy and bring the best out of your players. From local tournaments all the way up to Grand Slams, the future of tennis champions lies in your hands. Are you up for the challenge?<br><br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1433010/extras/Description_Steam_Features_ENG.png?t=1647878882\" /><br><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Enter the Tennis World</strong><br>Take on tennis tours with over 2000 tournaments. Live true-to-life management experiences in a dynamic Tennis World: coming from junior and pro circuits, over 5000 players are eager to walk on the road to success with their new manager.<br><br></li><li><strong>Grow your academy</strong> <br>Enter the academy of your choice, or create your own from scratch. Tennis courts, medical facilities, business centers or your own tennis school: you will be able to build all of these to make your academy shine and become renowned worldwide. While costly, upgrading your academy’s infrastructure will allow you to hire more staff, increase business opportunities, and attract talented players.<br><br></li><li><strong>Manage your finances</strong> <br>Players, staffs, investors: there’s too much money and too many nice guys around. Whether you create your own academy, join a small one, or choose a world-famous institute, there will be many opportunities to earn money… and to spend it. Part of your job is to monitor your academy’s financial health, which is why you have access to many tools and staffs.<br><br></li><li><strong>Build your team</strong> <br>Each player has their set of strengths and weaknesses that you’ll have to factor in to recruit &amp; get the best out of them. Dozens of parameters govern how each player behaves, both in and out of the field. Playstyle, favorite surface, morphology, temper, physical condition: all these aspects make each player unique. As a manager, you are given a set of analytical tools that help you better grasp your players and follow their evolution over time. <br><br></li><li><strong>Manage your team </strong> <br>While managing your Pro Team’s schedule, you will shape your players the way you choose to. Set up your own training routines or follow your staffs’ recommendations. Deal with equipment brands for each player: new look or big income? The choice is yours. You have access to many iconic brands of the sport such as Wilson, Lacoste or ASICS and their latest 2021 collections.<br><br></li><li><strong>Give pep-talks &amp; interviews </strong> <br>Being a skilled analyst will make you a good manager. Being a great speaker will make you an excellent one. Whether it is to buy some time on your hierarchy who’s harassing you for results or to gain the favors of the press, daily talks are part of a manager’s life. Before an important match or in-between 2 sets, your players need to know they can count on your rhetorical skills to give them that extra boost they need. Or just let the racket do the talking. <br><br></li><li><strong>Coach your players in real time </strong><br>A unique 3D match engine with 3D match stats gives you the power. Select pre-made game plans for a faster kickoff, or dig into every aspect of your players’ playstyles. Should they return down the line or at the center? High or low power? With proper coaching, your players are ready to steal the limelight and start piling up Grand Slam trophies for your academy!<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1433010/extras/Description_Steam_Challenge_ENG.png?t=1647878882\" /></li></ul>\n"

Whether you enjoy burning foes with damage over time, launching shuriken shaped blasts, shooting 4 shots simultaneously in a cone, piercing through enemies or firing at hit-scan speeds, the <i>Shop</i> has your creativity covered. <br>With thousands of combinations, your choices matter in your spaceship's growth and will affect your experience moving forward at harder rounds. Purchase power in small increments each round, or save your points to large amounts to see the <i>Shop</i> offer some higher-level supreme upgrades. <br><br>You can choose to play a quick session on-the-go (casual, 5-10 minutes), experience the normal gameplay at its best (normal, 25-30 minutes), or take on a harder realm to truly exercise your precision (hard, ~1 hour).<br>Enjoy our assortment of soundtracks to soothe your session, or get invigorated with an upbeat tune.<br><br><i>Save</i> your best gameplay session on the global leaderboards and see how you fare against others around the world, in any category! <br><br>And all for the price of a cup of coffee.<br><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1432400/extras/FinalGif1.gif?t=1602280685\" /><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>CONTROLS</strong>  — All with a mouse</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>Move at insane speeds</strong> - your spaceship's position is where your mouse cursor is. <br></li><li><strong>Shoot simply and easily</strong> - launch shots upwards with a click or hold click to continuously shoot. </li></ul><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><strong>FEATURES</strong>  — Ever-growing with updates</h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li> Wide variety of starting spaceships each with their own benefits and traits<br></li><li> Randomized enemy spaceships with unique attack styles each round<br></li><li> Creative bosses with stimulating skills that'll challenge your dodging precision<br></li><li> An upgrade system that allows you to build upon your spaceship (power, size, speed, flame shots, homing shots, spread shots, and more!) <br></li><li> Global leaderboard with statistics and records of gameplay sessions from other players<br></li><li> Adaptive <i>Shop</i> system - dynamically displays upgrades relevant to your income and availability<br></li><li> Large range of background soundtracks to harmonize with your experience<br></li><li> Three difficulty modes (casual, normal, hard) to suit your skill level and time available</li></ul><br><img src=\"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1432400/extras/SpecialThanks3.png?t=1602280685\" /><br><strong>Christian Then</strong> — Full-game German translations.\n"
